# Rails For Zombies 2 Watch Us Build

*We changed the name of this series to "Watch Us Build," so you may see an occasional reference to its former name ("Soup to Bits") in this repository.*

This is the app built in the [Watch Us Build episode](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/build-a-reading-list-app-with-ruby-on-rails) for the [Rails for Zombies 2 course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-2).

In order to run this locally, you must run:

* `bundle`
* `rake db:setup`
* `rails s`
